## Before You Contribute

Before you contribute, please consider that Datastar is developed and maintained by a a small team of core contributors in a private repo. The source code for each version is made available in the public repo.

## Bug Reports

Before submitting bug reports, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues) and the _#help_ channel in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bnRNgZjgPh) to see if it has already been addressed. When submitting a [new issue](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/new), please use a descriptive title and include a clear description and as much relevant information as possible.

## Feature Requests

Before requesting a new feature, please consider that Datastar is a lightweight JavaScript framework that aims to simplify reactive web apps by using a minimalist, attribute-based approach for state management and event handling directly in HTML. If you have a need for a feature that is outside of this scope, consider using a Web Component or writing your own Datastar plugin.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests must be made to the `develop` branch, have a descriptive title and clearly describe the problem and solution. If the pull request adds or changes behavior, documentation and examples should be updated accordingly.
